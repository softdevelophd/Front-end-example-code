We may also collect date in respect of any network used to connect with our website and where appropriate time zone. This does not identify any individual.</p>

					<p>We may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide.

					<!-- //4 -->
					<h3 class="heading bb-1"><i>4.</i> Use of cookies</h3>
					<p><b>4.1 What are cookies?</b></p>
					<p>Like most websites, this Website uses cookies and similar technology. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.</p>
					<p>On this website cookies are used for anonymous measurement of which pages users visit. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>
					<p>During the course of any visit to the Funeral Zone website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>
					
					<p><b>4.2 How does the Funeral Zone website use cookies?</b></p>
					<p>Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of Funeral Zone’s visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience.

					<p>Funeral Zone also uses various independent measurement and research companies who gather anonymous information regarding the visitors to Funeral Zone’s website on Funeral Zone’s behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on Funeral Zone’s website. We use this type of information to help improve the services we provide to Funeral Zone’s users. All third parties are strictly required not to use any information for their own business or other purposes.</p>

					<p><b>4.3 Third Party cookies on Funeral Zone pages</b></p>
					<p>Please note that during your visits to the Funeral Zone website you may notice some cookies that are not related to Funeral Zone. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Vimeo, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. Funeral Zone does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third party websites for more information about these. If you register with us or if you continue to use the Website, you agree to Funeral Zone’s use of cookies.</p>

					<!-- //5 -->
					<h3 class="heading bb-1"><i>5.</i> How will we use the information about you?</h3>
					<p>We collect the information about you to process your order, manage your account, and to email you about other products and services.</p>

					<p>We collect usage information about you when you use the Services. We will not share your information with any third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

					<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Funeral Zone, its customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may also disclose your personal information to any person, firm or company who acquires or proposes to acquire any relevant part of Funeral Zone’s business to which your information relates or in respect of which it is used.</p>

					<!-- //6 -->
					<h3 class="heading bb-1"><i>6.</i> Where we store your personal data</h3>
					<p>Although Funeral Zone’s servers are located within the European Economic Area (‘EEA’) the nature of the world wide web is such that data may be transmitted outside of the EEA and it may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of Funeral Zone’s suppliers or a supplier to one of Funeral Zone’s suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Funeral Zone will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although Funeral Zone will do its best to protect your personal data, Funeral Zone cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk.</p>

					<!-- //7 -->
					<h3 class="heading bb-1"><i>7.</i> Your rights</h3>
					<p>We would like to send you marketing information about Funeral Zone’s products and services. You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing at any time by contacting us at support@funeralzone.co.uk or by sending a written request to FZ Ltd at Berkeley House, Dix’s Field, Exeter EX1 1PZ, United Kingdom.</p>

					<p>The Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of Funeral Zone’s partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>

					<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 (the ‘Act’) gives you the right to access information we hold about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Should you wish to access the information we hold about you, please contact us at the address provided above. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet Funeral Zone’s costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
